Spaceflight Mechanics - Mission to Venus

This project details some of the analysis required to plan a Solar Powered Satellite (SPS) mission to another planet, namely Venus.
The main points covered are:
          - The possbile launch windows from Earth to Venus
          - The Delta V required to manoeuvre the SPS into it's desired orbit around Venus
          - The eclipse analysis of the SPS to determine the amount of active solar power it can harvest
